## 1. Self Ownership > Freedom

Everyone wants to be free. "I want to be free" Everyone has thought this at some point in their life. Of course anyone can be free. You can go out into the wilderness and never return.

You are free to do whatever you want and yet there seem to be tetheres holding you back (finances is one for most people) Fundementally freedom is a constrait itself. It is nothing but a dream.

Something that is greater than freedom is power and self ownership. If someone has power and is able to own themselves then they do not need freedom. If you do not throw yourself away on other people and you know how to have yourself, you are your own.

Instead of going after freedom, power seems to be the thing that we really crave. Doing what we want and having the power to do so go hand in hand. Where someone does not do something they want to do you can be certain that a lack of power also is present.

"Even in the condition of slavery the own man reamains everything to himself. He only endures lacirations via the whip in order to not endure worse. The moment
he can free himself he does so with ease"

## 2. Self Enjoyment: a great pleasure

In life many people like to play it safe. They are content with their beggardly alotment because they think it is enough to simply be alive. 

What they fail to understand that in doing so they completely miss the bigger picture which is to actually enjoy your life.

Without self enjoyment life is meaningless. All philosophy fundementally seeks to accomplish the same thing. Philsophy is an attempt by man to gain greater understanding.

Why? One gains greater understanding in order to enjoy life more. Philosophers therefore all want to live life the best. So why not live life in accordance to what you want to do starting now.

Stop thinking in terms of getting xyz before you do xyz. Instead do what you want to do now. Figure out how you want to do it and get it done.

## 3. Control mechanisms

A lot of people think that the thoughts that they are having belond to them. Stirner thinks that your own thought are simply a result of conditioning. 

In a strictly Pavlovian sense you were first tamed by the stick and later with the words not the other way around. Therefore being taught a lesson in this sense makes no sense.

This is why so many people fail in their goals. They have a lot of faulty programs running in their mind that prevents them from success, because what was taught to them was not in their best interest.

Most people are not even aware that they are crabs in the bucket keeping each other down and in doing so keeping themselves down. The egoist understands this deeply and works around people until he has enought power to destroy them.
