## Overview

When Jane first came to us she was noticibly very high strung and unsure about her future both in online modeling and in her personal life

She had dropped out of college and always loved the idea of modeling online but she simply did not have the courage to do it.

We diagnosed her issue as twofold: First and foremost it was a mindset issue, secondly it was a state of being overwhelmed that could only be caused by not knowing what to do

We helped Jane discover herself and grow in her egoism through our consulting services, now Jane no longer has issues with self esteem and is able to go for the things she wants in life with nothing held back

  When I first became a Young Hegelian Egoist I was shy, scared to ask for what I wanted, had trouble with boundaries. Now 
  I am arrogant, go for what I want, set boundaries with people easily and don't feel bad about doing what comes natural to me
  which is to win and be happy.
