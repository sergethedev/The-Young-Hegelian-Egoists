## Overview

Stacy was a scientist studying at a very prestigious university (Ivy League) but science does not pay quite as much as other professions. Stacy had no desire to "sell out" and become a 

computer science student like so many of her friends, and besides, being a college student usually means having some finacial hardships

Sam Altman played poker in order to cover his college tuition, Stacy did OnlyFans. "OnlyFans is just as intellectual of a game as poker if not more so, I learned a lot about 
how the world really works and how to manage people directly by using the platform"

Stacy needed to change her mindset about how to look at OnlyFans. Instead of looking at it like it was degrading, she decided to view it more like a game. With our consulting she 
has learned how to play the social media game like a Chess grandmaster, using her mind just as much as her body.
