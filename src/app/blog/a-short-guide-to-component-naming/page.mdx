## 1. We are all Egoists

It is clear from quick observation of our current and previous landscapes that all of us are egoists. We can only think about things from the perspective of ourselves.

Even reflexive altruism is done as a result of deeply embedded ethics and is still egoistic. This is where we get this feeling that all of us are so similar. 

The evil and the good are all the same in that they are egoists. By understanding this we learn to unite with everyone yet at the same time distance ourselves entirely.

## 2. Self ownership

In this lifestyle we recieve a lot of hate. In life people try to manipulate us and use us. Through self ownership we learn how to "be rude"

We learn to believe in ourselves and go after the things that we actually want in life. We learn to look to ourselves as the ulimate authority. We do not wait for someone to come save us.

We save ourselves. Yes we may form connections with others but if they break we understand that nothing was lost. Nothing real can be lost. The only thing that we have is ourselves.

Every single person is an individual though society always tries to make them think that they are not. The individual is everything. Though some try to hide behind society they are not decieving us, they are individuals as well.

## 3. Not being a perfectionist

Everything that an egoist does is for himself. No matter what the egoist partakes in He/She does it for their own enjoyment. More perciecely put. They are more in touch with this dimension of doing everything for enjoyment than others.

Therefore the egoist does not do things out of validation. They do not care about sounding correct or sounding smart so other people can give them a round of applause. On the contrary the egoist might intentionally sound dumb.

For instance on social media often sounding dumber helps to increase engagment. The egoist is naturally good at this.
