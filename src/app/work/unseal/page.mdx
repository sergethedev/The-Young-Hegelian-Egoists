## Overview

Madison was already at the top of the heap and was playing the online modeling game at a very high level. She booked a consultation to see what we were all about and she was really impressed by our knowledge.

Learning about the game from someone who has experience working with hundreds of people at varying levels is extremely valueable, but so is being in the presense of other extremely successful individuals.

Madison was able to grow her brand, her knowledge, learn how to leverage herself better, and to figure out how to take things to the next level more easily.

  Studio did an amazing job building out our core blockchain infrastructure and
  I’m sure once PlaceboCoin rallies they’ll be able to finish the project.
